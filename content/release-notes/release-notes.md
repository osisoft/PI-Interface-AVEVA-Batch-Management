# Release Notes

PI Interface for AVEVA Batch Management 

**Version 5.1.1.10**

## Overview

PI Interface for AVEVA Batch Management collects data from the AVEVA Batch Management Batch Execution System version 8.1 SP1 and above. This interface automatically creates batches in the PI Event Frames in PI AF based on data from the AVEVA Batch Management SQL database. The interface automatically creates PI Tags and an AF Hierarchy to capture context around your process data.

The release is a maintenance release that focuses on improving the stability and usability of the interface.

| Work Item | Description                                                                     |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22133     | Attribute values referencing other event frames are captured regardless of the order event frames are created. |
| 22140     | Unirecord data sources are now included in unirecord imports and exports. |
| 22156     | Cache start and end times can no longer be permanently altered by arbitration events. |
| 22163     | SQL Native client print message was disabled for Oracle based interfaces. |
| 22172     | When removing an interface from PI Event Frames Interface Manager, it will also remove any associated services. |
| 22181     | When adding an interface to PI Event Frames Interface Manager, the instance ID will be initialized as the same value of interface ID. |
| 22209     | Interface will no longer have a delay in processing a batch when the local time is greater than GMT. |
| 22211     | MONITORTAGWINDOW now defaults to 0, meaning monitor tag counts don't get trimmed to the most recent <MONITORTAGWINDOW> days of activity and roll over at INT_MAX unless MONITORTAGWINDOW is deliberately set. |
| 22216     | Interface ID has been added to the message logs in order to uniquely identify log message.
| 22218     | All generated unirecords will have the placeholder [TIMESTAMP] have the format "YYYY-MM-DD" for a SQL source and "YYYY/MM/DD" for non SQL source like EVT files.
| 22221     | Monitor tags now accurately reflect the number of batches and their child events. |
| 22224     | Bifconfig properly creates new default virtual user service without errors. |
| 22235     | Interface configuration for RST and RET reads UnitedStates format standard. |
| 22245     | The unit procedure batch id attribute is controlled by the unit procedure recipe template batchid. |
| 22246     | BifConfig does not allow older interfaces to edit health tags. |
| 22249     | All batch interfaces remove passwords from INI file regardless of parameter capitalization. |
| 22250     | Merging issue causes unit procedure and operation not to close. |
| 22260     | Batch event frames no longer merge event frames when merging is disabled and unique ids don't match. |
| 22268     | All RST and RET within the configuration will be parsed as US format. Fix in current development branch and in 4.3.x.x Branch. |
| 22275     | A check that verifies that a Procedure Event Frame and a Unit Procedure Event Frame are both generated by the same interface instance before linking them together. |
| 22283     | The Event log source is created during the interface install step. |
| 22464     | For interfaces with a version 5.0.0 or greater, PI Event Frames Interface manager nows tail the windows event viewer instead of PI Message log. |
| 23177     | BifConfig now stores RST and RET as UTC Note that they can be edited in a local friendly time string and read into the interface correctly. When written by the configuration program, they will write the times out as UTC and a local time string as a comment. |
| 23747     | A delay (/DELAYBUFFER) was added so the source data is available at the time of query. This helps event start times. |
| 23793     | The Event log source will be created as part of the setup process. |
| 23794     | PI Interface for Wonderware InBatch is now AVEVA Batch Management. |
| 24361     | All boost library calls were replaced with native C++ and STL functions. |
| 24661     | Boost is no longer used for JSON processing. Microsoft Net library replaces it. |
| 24781     | The interface setup kit is using the same GUID for all the interface. This causes trouble when installing another batch interface on the same machine. Fixed to use different GUID for each interface. |
| 24847     | SQL Native Client is no longer supported, and is now replaced with OLEDB for all supported batch interfaces. |
| 49860     | Configuration "USECLOSEEVENTSONLY" when checked in the PI Event Frame Manager will work properly. |
| 67289     | UniRecord exports now include all UniRecord fields. |
| 67650     | Event sorting is faster and memory consumption is better managed during event queuing. |
| 67926     | Interface will not allow Batch events with a zero start time. |
| 68207     | BifConfig will now store SCAN values as low as one second without complaint. |
| 68907     | Default account to setup interface service is now Default Virtual User (NT Service/<Interface Instance Name>). |
