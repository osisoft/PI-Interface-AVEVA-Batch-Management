# Introduction to PI Interface for WonderWare InBatch

PI Interface for WonderWare InBatch collects batch processing events from the WonderWare InBatch System, which automates equipment arbitration and concurrent batch management capabilities to maximize asset utilization, plant throughput and operational efficiency. The interface stores event data in PI Batch Database, and collects associated batch data for PI Tags and PI Batch properties. Associated batch data, such as recipe variables, is retrieved by querying the InBatch Historian during each interface scan. The interface provides status for Batch, Unit, and Phase level states.
