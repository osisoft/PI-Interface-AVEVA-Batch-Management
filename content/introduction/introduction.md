PI Interface for AVEVA Batch Management collects batch processing events from the AVEVA Batch Management System, which automates equipment arbitration and concurrent batch management capabilities to maximize asset utilization, plant throughput, and operational efficiency. The interface stores event data in either the PI Batch Database or PI Asset Framework and collects associated batch data for PI Tags and PI Batch properties. Associated batch data, such as recipe variables, is retrieved by querying the InBatch Historian during each interface scan. The interface provides status for Batch, Unit, and Phase level states. Additionally, this interface supports legacy FoxBatch functionality.
